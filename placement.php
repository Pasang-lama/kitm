                Kantipur Institute of Technology and Management (KITM) is a college that is driven by a software company that provides professional training and internship opportunities. Not just that, KITMâ€™s founders have been working within the Information Technology industry for many decades and have built a rapport that the students can benefit from.

                The college has industry tie-ups that will help the graduates jump-start their careers in respectable professional positions. The dedicated placement cell aids the students through the whole process. Vacancies from various corporate houses are regularly posted on our notice boards and shared within our student online groups, allowing students to choose the job opportunities that best align with their career goals. Once a student selects a job, they contact our placement cell, which then initiates the placement process.

            </p>

                In routine intervals, KITM also invites influential individuals from the IT industry and hosts seminars where the students can learn more about the current market trends, and workplace expectations, and prepare for their careers firsthand. On the flip side, the college also organizes field visits to different institutions and organizations where the students can learn and find inspiration for success.
